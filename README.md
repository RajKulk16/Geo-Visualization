# Geo-Visualization
Geo-Visualization helps in visualizing various maps of the world on a different scale. This project is done to understand more about folium. Folium is a powerful data visualization library in Python is built primarily to help people visualize geospatial data. I have used two tiles - Stamen Terrain and Stamen Toner. Some data is also viewed on the map.
